this conference will now be recorded

uh he know how to create account not a

problem he's a working consultant

okay okay right yeah

guys as we discussed earlier

about running

okay

contains four major sections

one is functional number two technical

number three integration part number

four cloud in agent Azure part okay and

as I told you in the demo of time

meanwhile we are going to complete two

projects one with regular

base every day we used to do some

Project work on that instance trial

instance while we are learning the

concepts another one is at the end of

the complete training I'm going to

assign you one project where you will do

it by yourself and I'll guide you how to

done what to do there are two things

which you are going to cover okay

there's a part of uh regularization it's

not a demo part today onwards the

session is started training is started

today we are going to cover a functional

module that is sales module since there

are few guys who doesn't know how to

create the trial instance and how to get

into the CRM I will start from code from

base like how to get it starting from

how to create the right instance

so okay

topics which we are going to cover today

first one is how to create drag instance

second one what is admin dot

microsoft.com

third one is

what is

seals

module functional

flow we are going to see these things

today

the first one trial instance

you need to go to www dot

trials

Dot Dynamics

.com okay

so go to

so basically additions will be for the

30 days after that it is we need to

create a new Dimensions the data that is

created in the Traditions will be

available for the 45 days for the

customers who want to convert they're

trying to production after 45 the data

will be lost after 30 days the instance

will become inactive you can't create

the data but you can see the existing

data and the

customizations that you have done in the

trial instance you cannot

input you cannot move it from a one

driving instance to another transistence

it will not support okay there's a few

things that need to be known

about the trial instance

earlier uh we will have sales marketing

service

free services provideration everything

under one application now the divided

the applications into small apps okay

every model into small app we can

connect separately to each and every

model okay see first for the train

instance for the sales try for free

here actually when you are creating

transitions for the first time

we don't know the ID right so when you

click on

start for free here you'll get the link

without entering the ID the link will be

activated click on click here

it will guide you to create an account

for the trial instance email area of

your choice

what are the email ID that you have you

can go with that I mean even Gmail ID

will work here

okay but my suggestion is in order to

get the complete features in order to

get the complete features when you give

a Gmail ID the system will consider it

as

personal email ID personal ID okay

if you do any at the rate with the

domain name commercial domain name it

will consider it as

customer company account so temporarily

with the help of temp

email with the help of Camp email

you can create a domain

rather it

some domain some commercial domain so go

to Temp email

here it will give the ID okay here it

will leave the ID so copy this ID

some to the dimensions

and yields already here next now the

Microsoft thing set

whatever I domain that have created is

official one it's not a personal one of

course we can change that mainly later

okay I'll repeat this part

see when you register with a Gmail ID

Microsoft assumes that it's a personal

ID it may not give the complete features

of the dynamic CRM

if you create a temporary ID with some

domain business domain by using temp

mail.com okay

if you decide with this one Microsoft

thinks that you are working on some

company some business so every almost

all features will be available I suggest

you to create a temporary domain and

work on that okay now here we'll get the

details like

when credit

CRM

phone number you need to give the phone

number which is active because you'll

get the

prompt SMS prompt 9618

and here the company name temporary it

can give anything

employees five to nine or the tempting

magnetic issue creates you can give even

this domain name as a company name

gusra

right here India code because we will

get the message SMS for the verification

I write next

yes

text me it will send the verification

code

we need to enter the verification code

which way

get it through SMS

nine zero

nine

refine and four

verified

foreign

right next

[Music]

foreign

in

cloud in azure.com your account is

creating and the CRM license is

assigning to you

it's a try instance customer engagement

trial instance for 30 days as a global

administrator the initial user who log

into the system or who creates the

account is a global administrator he is

a super powerful

person who have entered access

everything okay in generally uh in real

in real time scenario they are the

people who will manage the account

application their system administrators

they are system administrators and we

are going to cover an admin module where

the roles and responsibilities of system

administrator are CRM administrator will

be uh I mean we will demonstrate there

you are going to learn what are the

responsibilities how the system

administrator perform his responsibility

and what are his responsibilities here

now you can change because

generally we don't get this mail right

so we can change the mail

you can write the original mail

save it

we need to give the address

mandatory fields

[Music]

foreign

so here earlier uh there they are just

creating the accounts But Here recently

they started asking for

pan and pan number pan card number okay

so your ID number pan card number give

the pan number here or any

um uh you will have account right

permanent account number with tax or any

credit card number if you give something

here it will register just to avoid the

duplicate instances just over the

duplicate instances from here the

registration is completed and you will

once the registration is done you will

get into admin.microsoft.com since I

already created a transitions I can't

give pan ID here but you guys just give

the pan details and click on Save it's

going to create a trial instance one

month 30-day style instance okay

but what is our trial instance come to

all admin centers

guys I will do some assignments for you

you know to do that one at the end of

the training today

every day I used to do that instant

classroom Labs One Second Avenue and I

yeah

I'll monitor in this instance without

even for the global administrator the

password is same if you want you can if

you want to check just login with my

Venture together it

tbs190 dot on microsoft.com

yeah we have

Devin's Dev environment trial

environment see guys when first you need

to go to admin.microsoft.com and then

all admin centers

and admin centers you'll have Dynamics

365 apps when you click on here you will

come to the Power Platform

this is the Power Platform the Power

Platform consists of environments in

real-time scenario every company will

create at least three training exchange

three environments

what are the three environments one is

admin environment sorry Deb enrollment

another one is stressed environment and

finally production neuronic this is

minimum minimum three the dev

environment have the access only to the

Developers

only to the developers software

Engineers who are going to develop the

features the tester environment will

have access only to the test engineers

test is there is where they will test it

this is called q18 where they will test

and confirm whether the developers want

their problem is as for the business

requirement or not if it's not as per

the business requirement they will raise

the bugs they will raise the bugs If

they raise the bugs automatically the

code comes back to the developers the

developers will fix that issue and again

they will

move it to the QA environment once the

QA

is confirmed once the QA is confirmed

that

everything is fine then it will go to

production environment

who will move the move the change into

production one bacteria team will move

to the code from keyword to production

so developers never have direct access

to production creative team will have

the production some big companies that

is another environment called pre-prod

pre-prod environment where they will

have the customer

Curative customer engagement query where

they will press the requirements and if

it is correct working as per expected

then they will allow to move to the

production they will move the production

even test security don't have the access

to the production I'll repeat the

environments once again

okay there are generally for the small

companies three environments for the big

companies we have four environments the

first one is developers environment

where did her access to developers they

used to develop the code once it out of

the code they will test the same code in

QA environment they will move the code

to the QA environment in QA environment

the testing team will test the code and

they will confirm whether it is correct

a working as per expectation or not if

it is not they will raise the bugs and

create until the developers fix that

issue the code will not move to the

pre-broad environment once the issues

are fixed it will go to pre-prod

environment the pre-broad environment is

a customer environment where there are

business analyst functional Consultants

senior business analyst they will check

the code is working as per the

requirement or not if once they confirm

the requirement the code is working as

per as per the requirements these guys

will move to the production

so developers don't have access to qva

and pre-broad and keyway don't have

access to the production and pre-prod

will have the access to the production

this is hierarchy top two level so that

three level of testing will be done and

the perfect code will be moved to the

production so who will create the

environments

the global administrator will create the

environments where they will create the

environments in Power Platform admin

Center in Power Platform admin Center in

trial instances it will allow only one

environment to create if you try to

create another environment

by default you will get one default

environment Additionally you can create

one more environment if you try to add

another environment the system will not

Arrow because it will the trial instance

will give only 5 GB for each instance

more than 5gb data they don't allow you

to give the data so if you try to create

one more trial instance it will say that

there is no allocated memory for you so

we will track let us see what will

happen new

choose

okay

QB and environment we'll try to create

QA environment

giveaway environment

India and here the region based on the

region what you selected

the currency will be allocated if you

select USA the currency will be

dollars if you select India the currency

will be rupee and once you at the time

of creating any environments whatever

the name that you will give and whatever

the the currency that you select that is

the final one you cannot change one

software creating trial instance few

things are

cannot be deleted and cannot be changed

that is

the currency what you have given will be

fixed you can't change the currency once

it is created the second thing is the

instance name what you created with the

help of the name with that name the

business unit root business unit will be

created the root business units never be

deleted never to be deleted but you can

rename you can change the name of the

root business unit this is the interview

questions you will get

what if I want to change the base

currency in my instance how will you

change that one you need to say the base

currency never be changed you can't

change only it will be created at the

time of creating trial instance

if you want to change the base currency

you need to create an exchange currency

exchange currency the exchange currency

will act as a base connection to the

customer okay if the customer is paying

amount from USA to the India

instance

he can pay it into the dollars and it

will convert into the rupees and it will

store as a rupees in the base currency

but the exchange currency what it will

do it will convert that exchange

currency into base currency don't worry

about how how to do all this thing I let

you I'll tell you in the future sessions

but if this is a time to learn the what

are the standard features that will not

change

the business unit name can't be deleted

the base currency can't be changed

okay

these two uh just remember these two

things now while creating an environment

remember that go to trials subscription

based child subscription based when you

select the trial subscription base

automatically creating a database will

become visible

see this is disabled

if you go with sandbox or if you go with

production or if you go with

trial it is available but ours is trial

subscription based automatically this is

disabled pay as you go through Azure

this is a part of an Azure Cloud

environment whatever we are doing

everything we are doing on the cloud

so if you go as a trial if you go as a

trial then the

it will allow you to create a database

but let me check okay let us check

whether it will allow it or not see

language also you can't change base

language

there is a transactional language where

you can install

uh even you can install Hindi Telugu

Marathi kannada all all Global languages

there is a separate package that will be

available with the Microsoft we need to

purchase that I'm going to import then

the Translating language will be

available but base language whatever the

country that you selected that language

will be applicable okay currency is also

applicable

once this is done deploy sample data yes

I want a sample data for the practice

purpose but once you deploy the sample

data you can't be deleted you can't be

deleted if you are preparing this

instance for the production or for the

live never install the trial instance

trial data never installs the train data

for the practice purpose install the

trial data okay install the dry data

click on Save

click on Save

the unit domain name will be generated

click create the custom domain

okay by default it will create

a domain name right so I am giving

the name of the domain as TBS QA

EBS QA

save

so see you have reached the maximum

limit of one trial environment you can't

create

because that is a limitation given to

the trial instance so what we choosed we

created Dev environment there's a

default environment provided within

Microsoft this is a different

environment which is created by us okay

now you guys just go to

price.dynamics.com create your own

instance get into admin module from that

get into admin Dynamics apps from there

create an environment by default you

will have only one environment now you

need to create one more environment one

more environment okay

now I am opening the dev environment

I am going to Dev environment what are

apps that we have in the development

guys any questions so far

am I going speed

or you guys following me

or do you have any questions any

suggestions

feel free to uh

ask anything guys because this is the

first session

we are going to work on this

for next or most two months

you'll get any questions

iPhone

right

oh yes but sir so a little bit means

slow means

Sharif

sharath

Salman Anand if you okay okay as Bobby

said I'll make it a little slow okay no

worry I will give a guide how to go step

by step things you follow that one now I

will share the environment link this is

the environment link

for our Dev environment for our daily

unit whatever the assignments that I

will provide give to you you need to

work on this this

environment so just

click on

click on this link

once you click on this link

it will prompt you to enter the username

and password

what I'll do is

I'll go with private window

copy

right click

new private window

okay now it will ask me

to log into system Diamond environment

with username what I'll do is

[Music]

go with one of your

IDs

under user active users

let me go with the

TV Style

okay

okay then

next

one two three four capital A B C B

any

signing

yes

so barish is ideally logged into the

development endurance CRM

he should right because he have the

trial instance

but he can't he's getting the error

why that is one question

and I will share the password

because

a part of admin dot microsoft.com but

bhavesh doesn't have any role in CRM

okay

admin.microsoft.com is a cloud

environment which is a cloud environment

where his Global administrator created

the users

but he did not mention bhavish is a part

of which account

here there are so many accounts active

directory Dynamics c65 apps powerapps

power automate right so I have given the

license but in order to access all these

things he must have the role he must

have some role in Dynamics here

so as a global administrator I should

create

a role in Dynamic CRM to him I should

assign a role in Dynamic CRM

okay now

now I am getting into

Dynamic CRM

go to advanced settings

advanced settings

I know guys you are little

the confusion will create now at this

time because you are very new to the

environment and we are moving between

different modules

first we started with the trial instance

we went to admin module now we are

coming into security model because this

is a way how the real-time scenario

works this is this is the way how the

relative similar Labs will works I can

create a trial instant and I can right

away get into anywhere and I can start

the sales module

straight away but

95 percent of the trainers they will

never teach these things because the

strength feels like little tough they

will straight away get into CRM sales

model and they will simply explain the

functional functional part but once you

enter the real time office then you

don't know all these things which is

very important which is mandatory which

is mandatory so try to cooperate with me

though it is little tougher practice at

home and ask me tomorrow if any queries

I'll clear that okay so don't feel

burdened it's a mandatory thing so what

I am teaching you is mandatory so now

Barbies need a role I am an

administrator I need to assign a role to

bhavesh further what I need to do I need

to come to my Divine environment once I

come to Denver environment I need to go

to settings

advanced settings

in the advanced settings

I will come to

settings

and then

security and then Security in the

security I need to go to users

I need to go to users

here and you search

yeah so we got Bobby CRM

ID here now we'll assign a role to him

manage rules

I wanted to give access Barbies only for

the sales module okay I want to go only

for the sales model so what I need to do

is I need to assign the role here I need

to assign the role here so let me check

the sales role

wow

service role

later I will promote me as an admin but

currently I will give a role 2 as a

sales role

if you

service the system administrator

there is no cell sold here

welcome

I will give him uh

system customizer role system customizer

role okay

I have given him a system customer's

role

now barish can log into the system now

bavish can log into system

if I try to

sign out and sign in to the

developer environment

password is incorrect so if one two

three four chapter a b c d

signing

correct

to refresh so this we assigned role just

now

to update in cloud and it will take some

time it will take some time after five

to ten minutes we'll try to login again

with the babish ID now we'll try to give

uh

Sheriff I'll search

user here

Sharif

meanwhile

while searching for Sheriff name

but it is not there

why tariff why your name is not

inflicting here

because sir is forever to barish

am I right

why Sheriff name not here

let us check with Anand let us check

with another name

another name also not there

here everybody name is reflecting

under users

which is

yeah yeah what could be the reason guys

guess

because it hasn't been imported into the

Dynamics environment yet the user

profile

but why why should only imported

because it's a global admin

no no no no he's a normal user like you

maybe because of the role you applied

no I haven't I I send role later right

one first he could not he got an error

after ascending role he can be logged

into the system

so this is a bug this is a bug for the

trial instance what your name should be

activated or maybe by Design I don't say

bug or by Design once you try to log

into the environment then it is

activating the user rows for you will

get the error and even your name will be

activated your name will be activated so

that's when it's important you meant to

say that's when it's important exactly

exactly at that time it is importing

till that time we try to log in it's not

importing though we are creating users I

think so it's by Design right

it's but it is not it shouldn't be right

see I I got a license

no you might be having license but you

haven't put up a rule at the application

Level to import all users from Azure

into Dynamics but but who is the person

who is the person going to assign the

role Global administrator that is

a globally administrator when control is

true to assign the user license license

as well as role in the CRM

and the environment group you mean to

say the role ah yeah role so if I don't

find the Salman or Anand nobody here

rahuda is saying should I ask him

without without the role you go and try

for the login obviously it gives error

yeah

that is

yeah actually it's a bug but by Design

both so guys all I should try to log in

to this Dev environment I showed you a

link right please copy paste it into

your notepad Okay try to log into this I

lost those links in the chat because I

had to reconnect can you please repost

it to me please yeah yeah I will I will

re send everything invest my copy paste

please paste everything into local my

sincere advice is

try to

maintain a book from day one onwards

write everything on that book write your

queries on that book

and ask at the end of the session that

will be the best practice and these

every day I use student minimum five to

six interview questions note it down

because I'm a part of the panel I took

almost more than 50 interviews okay

eighty percent of the interview

questions will be covered while giving

the training where I will give the

training just note it down on the book

so that you will link up to these

questions because when you read it on

the uh I practice time it will register

for you forever you can face the

interview without any issue and this is

the lifetime practice

open the book 300 Page book within two

to three years

you will have every question on that

throughout your credit it will be

helpful for you throughout your career

please create one guide for yourself

please note it down on the book and

write it on the with the pen this is the

best practice which I used to follow

which I used to follow okay whether you

can maintain it in the soft copy or hard

copy what's up to you whether you want

to open a book or you can maintain it on

the notepad it's up to you but start

writing the questions from today okay

dragons uh so I have a small request I

don't have my username in there like the

email address

yeah everybody's the same formula your

name followed by CRM domain name on

microsoft.com

is a username and the password is shift

one two three four capital A B C B these

are possible one of you please try to

login then only your users will be

activated so that I can assign the rules

note on the labs for today note on the

labs for today

one is

create

file instance

we'll do I'll write it the notepad and

I'll paste one set it and

that's for today

first bodies

pay trial instance

second thing is

create

users

third thing is

assigned

Dynamics

365

engagement trial license

fourth one is

create

Dev environment

create their environment

okay I'll ask Ravi to share this

training recorded session Whenever there

is a difficulty when you are getting

into multiple uh links I will ask Rabbi

to share those links or record sessions

all recognitions will not be provided

but whenever wherever we'll feel there

is a difficulty to remember to follow

then or ask rabbit to share a video

recorded video only for few sessions all

together you will get 10 such videos

okay there are 10 different areas where

you it is difficult to follow for you

guys I know this is the first day and we

are we are connected to different things

trial instance admin module and again

Power Platform and finally into CRM

there are multiple steps that's why I

will ask Ravi to share today's video you

just follow that and practice it

so that's it for today's session slowly

we'll increase the time otherwise it

will become a burden for you usually I

will take one or one and a half hour

every day every day okay so any

questions on today's uh I mean session

guys

previously I created

you created Island since yes

okay good then you can go with that for

your practice and try to login into our

classroom instance for the assignments

which I have given

foreign

your own trial instance and then once

you get the output you do the same in

our incident classroom instance so that

I will Monitor and I can I know what you

guys are doing

at the end of the uh I mean 30 days I

can tell you who are all practicing and

who are not practicing

based on that

so it's for monitoring purpose just do

the assignment water I'll give in

regular class instance and practice in

your own instance

any questions

so can we use trial instance which you

created just to do our stuff rather than

creating new one no no you can use it

see why I'm only asking you to get a

tile instance

for your own practice there are

differences

ah practicing for your own purpose once

you practice that and you'll get the

output after that you can implement the

same in our classroom instance so that I

can understand what you are doing

yeah

that's the idea behind creating your own

relations other than that nothing we can

work on the one instance everybody I am

going to give you an system

administrator in future

I'll first I'll send you the customizer

and then sales administrator and slowly

into system administrator so that you

can understand the hierarchy in the

security module

still when creating the environment you

created the trial

you can practice on the day when you run

I shared you the David environment you

can't create any environments in in our

classroom thing because only one

environment additionally is limited it

won't allow you to create anything

my question is like can we create a

security group and then relate it at the

start and then restrict that is what the

idea it is is under security module

under security module I am going to

divide you guys into three different

groups groups okay friends yeah sales

marketing and admin our training is

totally different you will understand

slowly it's not like outside training

it's not like outside and like just

starting with functional and they will

cover 30 days for the function they will

say almost done no we are not like that

that's why I have done a clear cut idea

our training is four modules

two weeks for Consulting and

administration two weeks for technical

2x Square integration and 2 weeks for

azure

we will cover everything

I am going to create a groups and I will

assign the rules all business processes

and business employees everything

everything

uh I ask rabi to share the content I

already given the content to Ravi there

you can see what order we are going to

cover the topics business process flows

workflows custom workflows actions

dialogues everything is going to cover

all this comes under the processes you

say four day session four day session

by Davis I have given the training plan

you can monitor that and you can go yeah

take that take it from Ravi I already

handed more than 50 batches I have 11

years of experience only in CR and Dot

Net 10 years all together 20 years I'm

an architect

yeah

yeah no worries guys just believe me and

follow me most of the guys are very

serious initially just within two weeks

they will leave the training aside and

they don't practice

the people who practice you always till

now there are submissions are connected

to me they are very happy but you don't

practice waste none of the people will

help you

till the time

you are strong in the subject

the subject is your god

and subject is a food supplier

subject is everything if you are strong

in subject you will travel travel

globally

you will hike your service

and you will be the king of the

workplace

so please please practice practice every

day till the training completes every

day just spare

two hours one hour by the class one hour

for the practice and ask me after four

weeks eight weeks

where you land

if you don't practice nobody can help

you nobody maybe there are shortcuts to

get the jobs and all but those are

temporary

you'll get jobs very fast mannered with

shortcuts and you will lose the jobs in

the shortcut manner very fastly even

though you sustain you don't get the

peace

you don't get the peace in the workplace

so these statements because I don't want

to point anyone

but we do the subject to practice just

practice I'll cover everything
